**How to use the plugin:**
- If you downloaded the plugin from the [Unreal Marketplace](https://marketplace-website-node-launcher-prod.ol.epicgames.com/ue/marketplace/en-US/product/restart-editor-01) skip to the next step, if you downloaded it from GitHub copy the "RestartEditor" folder inside "Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/"
- Enable the plugin in the "Plugins" window
- Restart the editor
- You should have an icon in the top bar, click it or press CTRL+SHIFT+R to restart the editor.
- If you want to enable by default the extension for all your project, edit the "RestartEditor.uplugin" file that you can find in the folder: "Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/RestartEditor" and set "EnabledByDefault" to true.
