**How to use the plugin:**

- Enable the plugin in the "Plugins" window
- Restart the editor
- You should have an icon in the top bar, click it or press CTRL+SHIFT+R to restart the editor.
- If you want to enable by default the extension for all your project, edit the "RestartEditor.uplugin" file that you can find in the folder: "Engine/Plugins/Marketplace/RestartEditor" and set "EnabledByDefault" to true.
